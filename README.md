# Python Discord Bot using Discord.py API wrapper

## A personalized Discord bot written in Python using the Discord.py API wrapper and deployed using Render.

## Tweaking this project for your own use

* Customize botmain.py how you please, you may have to remove the client variable and associated aspects to it if you don't have a mongo database. Reset the Bot Token variable to the token of your choosing.
* In scraper.py, you can reset the API Key to one of your choosing if you have an OpenWeatherMap API Key or remove the file entirely

## How to run this bot yourself
  
1. Clone this project
2. Set up a bot in your discord developer portal
3. Use pip to download Discord.py
4. Using visual studio code or a command line interface you can execute the following command:
```
 python -u "your_path\cogs\botmain.py"
```

## Deploying
Currently, the personal version that I am running is hosted using Render.com which is a monthly paid service, feel free to take a look here if that interests you: [https://render.com/]

## Issues

This project is a constant and ongoing project. While progress on it has slowed down since it is in a place that I am comfortable with if there is something I wish to add or something that gets pointed out to me, I will try my best to implement it.
